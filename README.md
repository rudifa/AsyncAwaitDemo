# chatGPT writing swift code

The code in the ViewController was generated by the chatGPT in response to my prompts and questions.

The transcript is found [here](chatGPT-QA-session.md).

Overall, it did generate several useable solutions, but also some that did not compile, and some others that compiled but did not work.

My initial prompt was

```
In a UIViewController, I want to fetch an image form a public website, 
asynchronously, and display it in a UIImageView
```

My last prompt was 

```
ok, this works; can you improve it by adding a button to press to get another image?
```

and the generated code works.

In between, I tried to get a modern (as of 2022) swift solution using async/await and throw/catch, but it never got there. It looks as if it was trained on material that is about a year old.

Anyway, this is impressive, from a truly general-purpose AI system.

Here is the app, in a simulator.
